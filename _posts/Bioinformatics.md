## 1) WEEK 1 Class Notes

### Introduction

- **4 steps of bioinformatics**

  0. **Questions - Biological/Medical Knowledge**
     - What is the Biological Basis of Consciousness?
     - Why do Humans Have So Few Genes?
     - To What Extent Are Genetic Variation and Personal Health Linked？

  1. **Information - Biological/Medical Data**

     - Images

     - Sequences - DNA/RNA Sequence

       	- Revolution of Biology: Sequencing Technologies (Human Genome Project)

       - Features: complex, diverse and numerous 

       - Metagenomics(Far more than Human): Environmental and Organismal 

  2. **Analysis (core step) - Data Clean & Feature Extraction**

     NGS Data Analysis: 

     1. Sequencing Method + Bioinformatics Tool
     2. Interpreting the Data: Cell Types, Gene Signatures, etc.

  3. **Modeling - Probabilistic  Model & Computational Algorithm**

     - Machine Learning Models

       - Example

         1. Regression Model 

            Linear → Logistic Regression (*used for classification*)

            Continuous → 0/1

         2. Neural Network Model → Deep Learning

     - Computational Algorithms
       - Example
         1. Number Sorting Algorithm 
         2. Dynamic Programming Algorithm

     - ==Model vs Algorithm==

       - Model: formula + parameters

         establish the formula and calculate the parameters to predict the probability

       - Algorithm: logic + iterations 

         use logic and iteration to solve problems

- **My position**

  - [ ] Data problems

  - [x] Biology problems

- **The Fourth Paradigm**

  - Data driven

  - Steps
    1. Information
    2. Analysis
    3. Modeling
    4. Question

### Getting Started

1. Document your work - Github & Markdown

   - Examples of Markdown and Github

   - Software

2. Backup your work

   1. Basic

      - Cloud Storage

        [Tsinghua cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn)

      - Backup tool that comes with the system

      - Backup your code with Github

   2. Advanced

   3. How to use Bioinformatics Tutorial

### Setup

1. Learn a text editor

   - Vim

   - VS Code

2. Setup Docker

## 2) Learning plan for Bioinformatics this semester

- 本人编程基础较为薄弱，因此学习计划主要跟随本课程的教学计划，并在此基础上提升自己的编程能力。
